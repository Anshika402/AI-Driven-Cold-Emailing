# AI-driven-Cold-Emailing

**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

The Email Automation Tool is designed to streamline the email management process by parsing and analyzing emails from Google and Outlook accounts. OAuth authentication is implemented to securely access these accounts, ensuring the confidentiality of user credentials and data. Instead of OpenAI, sentiment analysis is employed to understand the tone and context of emails, assign labels automatically, and respond accordingly. Python serves as the development language due to its compatibility with sentiment analysis libraries.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED**

* Python: Chosen as the primary programming language
* OAuth: To facilitate secure authentication with Gmail and Outlook APIs
* Gmail API: To access and interact with emails in Gmail accounts securely.
* Outlook API: To access and interact with emails in Outlook accounts securely.
